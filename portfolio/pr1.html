              This is a description text. It describes how cool the project is.
              Wow, this text is so describable, isn't it? That is so cool.
              Anyway, just a little more description here and there. Okay, maybe
              a little bit more.
              <br /><br />
              Another descriptive paragraph. Some important things can be
              described here. Or maybe not so much important. This sentence is
              describing the process and details of this really cool projects.
              To sum up, the descriptive description is described here as
              something describable.
